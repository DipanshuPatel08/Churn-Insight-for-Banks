📄 Project Description: Customer Churn Prediction App

Overview:

This project is an interactive, AI-powered web application built using Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of a customer churning (leaving a service or company). Leveraging a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the app provides real-time predictions based on customer attributes such as age, balance, credit score, activity level, and more.

Key Features:
	•	🧠 Deep Learning Model (ANN): Trained to recognize churn patterns based on historical customer data.
	•	📊 Interactive UI: Users can input customer details via dropdowns, sliders, and number fields.
	•	🏷️ Smart Encoding: Utilizes pre-trained Label and One-Hot Encoders for categorical data.
	•	📐 Feature Scaling: Ensures consistency using a saved StandardScaler.
	•	🔍 Prediction Output: Displays churn probability using intuitive metrics and progress bars.
	•	⚙️ Backend & Deployment Ready: Built with modular components for easy integration and deployment.

Tech Stack:
	•	Frontend: Streamlit (Python)
	•	Modeling: TensorFlow / Keras (ANN)
	•	Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
	•	Model Serialization: Pickle

Use Case:

This solution is ideal for banks, telecom companies, or SaaS providers looking to proactively identify customers at risk of leaving, allowing for timely retention strategies.
